#procedure for git

🔹 Step 1: Install Git

Download Git for Windows 👉 https://git-scm.com/download/win

Run the installer:

Keep most options default.

When asked about Git Bash vs Command Prompt, select: “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”.

Choose your favorite editor (you can pick VS Code).

✅ After installation, open PowerShell or Git Bash, and check:

git --version


If it shows a version (e.g., git version 2.45.0), Git is installed.

🔹 Step 2: Configure Git (Identity)

Set your global username & email (replace with your GitHub details):

git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"


👉 To keep your personal email private, use GitHub’s no-reply email (found in GitHub → Settings → Emails).

Verify settings:

git config --global --list

🔹 Step 3: Connect Git to VS Code

Open VS Code.

Install the extension 👉 GitHub Pull Requests and Issues (official).

VS Code has Git support built-in, so your Git repos will appear in the Source Control tab (left sidebar).
