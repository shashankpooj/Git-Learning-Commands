ðŸ”¹ What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS).
That means it keeps track of the changes you make to files in a project over time.

Think of it as a time machine for your code:

You can save snapshots of your project (called commits).

You can go back to an earlier version if something breaks.

You can work with others without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.



ðŸ”¹ Why do we use Git?

Track history â€“ Every change you make is recorded.

Collaboration â€“ Many developers can work on the same project at the same time.

Branching â€“ Try new features in a separate branch without breaking the main code.

Backup â€“ Your code can be stored online (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
