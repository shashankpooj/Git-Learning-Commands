📝 Git Basics Cheat Sheet
🔹 Clone a Repository

Download a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
git clone <repository-link>

🔹 Check Status
See which files are changed, staged, or untracked.
git status

🔹 List Files
Show files in current directory:
ls

Show hidden files too:
ls -a


🔹 Important Notes

If git status shows a file in red → changes made but not staged.

To save changes, you must:

Add files to staging area

Commit them

🔹 Add Files
Move changes to the staging area.
git add <file-name>     # Add a single file
git add .               # Add all files


🔹 Commit Changes
Record the staged changes with a message.
git commit -m "Your commit message"

🔹 cd – Change Directory
cd lets you move between folders in your file system.
cd folder_name



🔹 Push Changes
Upload commits from your local repo to GitHub.
git push origin main

🔹 cd .. – Go Up One Folder
